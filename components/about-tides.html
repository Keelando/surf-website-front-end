  <h3>About Tide Data</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Tide observations</strong> are updated every 30 minutes from DFO (Fisheries and Oceans Canada)
    water level stations. <strong>Astronomical tide predictions</strong> are based on harmonic
    constituents and are updated daily.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Total Water Level</strong> combines astronomical tides with storm surge forecasts from
    Environment Canada's GDSPS model. Storm surge is the elevation of water caused by wind stress
    and atmospheric pressure changes during weather systems.
