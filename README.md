# surf-website-front-end

Static frontend for marine weather monitoring system (Salish Sea region).

## Linked Repository

This frontend is intrinsically linked to the **surf-website** backend repository.

- **Backend repo**: `~/envcan_wave/` - Python data collection and export scripts
- **Data bridge**: Backend exports JSON files to `~/site/data/`, frontend reads from there
- **See**: `docs/BACKEND_CONNECTION.md` for detailed integration guide

## Quick Start

The frontend reads JSON data files from `~/site/data/`:
- `latest_buoy_v2.json` - Real-time wave buoy data
- `tide-*.json` - Tide observations, predictions, and high/low events
- `timeseries_*.json` - 24-hour historical charts

These files are generated by the backend repository's Python scripts.

## Production Environment

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This directory (`~/site/`) is the live production environment.**

Changes pushed to the `main` branch and pulled to this directory are immediately live on the production site. There is no separate staging or deployment step.

## Development

When working in Claude Code with both repositories:

```bash
# Option 1: Multi-directory mode (CLI)
claude-code --add-dir ~/envcan_wave --add-dir ~/site

# Option 2: Work in parent directory
cd /home/keelando && claude-code .

# Option 3: Separate sessions (Web)
# Open each repo in its own Claude Code session
```

See `docs/BACKEND_CONNECTION.md` for complete integration details.
