# halibutbank.ca — Frontend

Static frontend for the Salish Sea marine weather monitoring system.

## Architecture

This frontend is a static site served by Caddy. It reads JSON data files exported by the backend Python scripts in `~/envcan_wave/`.

- **Backend repo**: `~/envcan_wave/` — Python data collection and export scripts
- **Data bridge**: Backend exports JSON to `~/site/data/`, frontend reads from there
- **Live site**: https://halibutbank.ca
- **See**: `docs/BACKEND_CONNECTION.md` for full integration details

## Pages

| Tides | `/tides.html` | `tide-latest.json`, `tide-timeseries.json`, `tide-hi-low.json` | Every 30 min |
| Winds | `/winds.html` | `stations.json` + Environment Canada feeds | Hourly |

## Production Environment

**This directory (`~/site/`) is the live production environment.**

Changes are immediately live — there is no staging step. The daily cron auto-commits data files and pushes to git.

## Development

When working across both repos in Claude Code:

```bash
# Multi-directory mode
claude --add-dir ~/envcan_wave

# Or work from parent
cd /home/keelando && claude .
```

See `docs/BACKEND_CONNECTION.md` for complete integration details.
